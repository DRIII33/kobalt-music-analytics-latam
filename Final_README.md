Project README.md: Latin American Artist & Market Analysis
This project demonstrates a data-driven approach to talent scouting and deal evaluation in the Latin American music market. It was developed to simulate the responsibilities of a Research & Deals Analyst, focusing on how data can be used to identify high-potential artists and improve deal structuring efficiency.

Project Goal
The primary objective of this project is to create a unified, actionable data product that integrates disparate datasets (streaming, airplay, and social media) to provide a clear, predictive view of an artist's potential. This framework helps A&R teams move beyond simple chart performance, thereby reducing risk and improving the efficiency of the deal evaluation process.

Methodology
The project follows a comprehensive data analytics methodology:

Data Collection & Preparation (ETL): Simulated datasets for streaming, airplay, and social media were used. These were ingested, cleaned, and transformed using SQL in Google BigQuery to create a unified data schema.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): The integrated dataset was queried to identify top-performing artists and songs in key Latin American markets. Trend analysis was performed to identify emerging artists and genres with significant growth.

Predictive Analysis: A simple predictive model was developed to forecast an artist's future streaming performance. The project also analyzed the correlation between social media engagement, airplay, and streaming success to understand the most effective growth channels.

Deal Evaluation Framework: A scoring model was created in SQL to rank artists based on a composite score derived from their streaming growth, social engagement, and airplay. This model serves as the "futures' creative works analysis model" for deal consideration.

Visualization & Dashboard Outputs: Google Data Studio was used to create three interactive dashboards: a high-level LatAm Music Market Dashboard, a detailed Artist Deep-Dive Dashboard, and a Deal Pipeline Dashboard that visualizes the "Deal Viability Score" and key performance metrics.

Key Insights & Recommendations
The analysis revealed crucial insights that informed the final strategic recommendations:

Growth Trajectory is Key: The analysis confirms that focusing on artists with the highest growth potential score, as identified by the predictive model, is a more effective strategy than simply signing the biggest names.

Cross-Platform Insights: A strong correlation was found between social media engagement and streaming success. The dashboard highlights this by integrating metrics like followers and engagement rate, advising A&R teams to use these insights to identify promotional opportunities and measure audience connection.

Process Improvement: By automating the initial artist scoring and providing a clear, interactive dashboard, the project demonstrates how to significantly reduce the time spent on manual research. This allows the team to focus on the most promising candidates, thereby improving overall deal flow efficiency.

This project successfully integrates technical skills in SQL, data visualization, and predictive analysis with a deep understanding of the music business, providing a powerful, data-driven tool for strategic decision-making in the Latin American music market.
